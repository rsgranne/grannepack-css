## [0.3] - 2021-02-25

Ritwick Dey isn’t maintaining Live Sass Compiler any longer, & it causes a crash of all extensions with an error messages of “Extension host terminated unexpectedly”, so I removed it & replaced it with Glenn Marks’ updated fork of Live Sass Compiler, which *is* maintained. Thank you, Glenn Marks! (That said, I really wish VSCode would just build this functionality in.)

## [0.2] - 2020-04-10

Removed CSS Peek by Pranay Prakash, since it’s built into VS Code (press ⌥F12 or Alt+F12 to invoke it).

## [0.1] - 2019-05-28

Initial release, with 6 extensions.
